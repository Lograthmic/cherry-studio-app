# Use Platform-Native Navigation Gestures

Cherry Mobile will rely on platform-native navigation behavior for Android edge back gestures, predictive back preview, and native stack transitions instead of simulating edge-swipe back in JavaScript. Expo Router and React Navigation native-stack should bridge these behaviors through `react-native-screens`, while Cherry-owned components handle safe-area/inset layout and only use local `BackHandler` interception for explicit product states such as unsaved edits or active generation confirmation.

**Considered Options**

- Build a custom JavaScript edge-swipe back gesture for Android.
- Disable system back preview permanently and handle all back behavior in app code.
- Use platform-native back gestures and native stack behavior.

**Consequences**

Android edge gesture zones are reserved for the system. Horizontal gestures such as drawers, swipe actions, and carousels must avoid fighting the system edge. `predictiveBackGestureEnabled` can stay disabled as a conservative default until navigation flows are stable, then be enabled and validated on real Android devices.
